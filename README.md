## Project setup:

Use ```https://developer.android.com/studio/``` to compile and run on the device.

## Setup with IMU sensor:
To connect sensor (see ```https://github.com/adiog/embed-esp-sensor```) directly to Android device:
* create 2.4GHz hotspot (with custom ssid/pass)
* hardcode the ssid/pass as well as the device IP and flash the sensor (see ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adiog/humanoid/master/misc/setup-sensor.sh```)
